      userQuestion: `Can I Join More Than One Register?`,
      chatResponse: `
     You only need to be signed up to one stem cell register, as we all work together to find a match for a patient.
 
     In order to join the Anthony Nolan register potential donors need to be aged 16-30 and be in good general health. You must be resident in the UK and must be willing to donate anonymously to anybody you match anywhere in the world.
 
     You can find our online application form here: https://www.anthonynolan.org/help-save-a-life/join-stem-cell-register 
     
     If you are over the age of 30, there are two other options. 
     DKMS, who accept new donors in the 17-55 age range.  Please see https://www.dkms.org.uk/en for more information or call 0208 747 5620.
     The British Bone Marrow Register, which is run by the NHS Blood & Transplant Service.  If you are interested in joining you can enquire at your next blood donor session, see their website https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/british-bone-marrow-registry/  or contact them on 0300 123 2323.
 
     Whichever register you join, you will be searched for every patient.
 
     We really appreciate your support!
